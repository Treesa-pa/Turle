# Turle
python turtle project
In this, we have a certain even number of tiles or blocks, in which each number  has a pair. The tiles (blocks) are facing downwards, and we have to flip them to see them. In a turn, one flips 2 tiles, if the tiles match then they are removed. If not then they are flipped and placed back in the position. We keep on doing this until all the tiles have been matched and removed.
